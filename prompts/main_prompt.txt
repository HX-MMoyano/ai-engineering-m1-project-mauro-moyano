# Prompt layout (anti prompt-injection)

- System instructions (role, schema, few-shot): prompts/system_prompt.txt
- User input: passed separately as the "user" message in the API (see src/run_query.py).

The model receives:
  1. role=system, content=<contents of system_prompt.txt>
  2. role=user,   content=<raw question only>

So user input is never concatenated into the system prompt.
